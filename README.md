# ConfigureRemotingforAnsible

An intention of the repository to maintain and extend the tool to configure WinRM listeners at Windows host managed by [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible).

The ConfigureRemotingforAnsible tool was initially shared as an example via the [Ansible](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/examples/scripts/ConfigureRemotingForAnsible.ps1) repository, and I retained the history of changes of it under creating the current project.

When I extended that tool first time, I opened [the pull request](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/48051) and discussed it under weekly Ansible-Windows group. Maintainers response [was not enthusiastic ;-)](https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/ansible-windows/2018-11-06/ansible_windows_working_group.2018-11-06-20.00.log.html) so I decided to maintain the ConfigureRemotingforAnsible outside of the Ansible repository.

I hope to find time to extend, improve, document this tool to be more admin-friendly and an enterprise-ready.

All constructive feedback and contribution are welcomed.
